# mukhroop
Mukhroop leverages traditional techniques, primarily relying on OpenCV, a powerful library for image and video processing. 
OpenCV provides pre-built functions for face detection, facial feature extraction, and image manipulation. NumPy is used for efficient data handling as well

1. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the script: python mukhroop.py

3. View results: The result image with detected faces will be saved as output.jpg in the project directory

Notes: Mukhroop uses the Haar Cascade classifier for face detection. Future scope : Exploring deep learning-based approaches.

### Instructions:

1. Copy and paste the code into respective files as mentioned above.
2. Install dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the script using `python mukhroop.py`.
